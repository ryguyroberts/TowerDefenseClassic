# Tower Defense Classic (TDC)


## Description
A browser game powered by the JavaScript library Phaser. The goal is to defend your base from approaching mobs! Mobs are defeated with the aid of player towers. The game cycle begins with a build phase, then transitions to the combat phase. During combat, the player watches as their towers either defeat all the enemies in the wave or let them through and lose a life. After a wave is over, it's back to the build phase where players spend currency gained from mobs to either build new towers or upgrade current ones. Each new combat cycle presents more difficult mobs, until eventually, either the player beats the max wave or runs out of lives.
